## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a functional and user friendly front end landing-page where a user can enter information on various animals as though this were a database.  The user can then cycle through various details on animals that have been created or that were pre-existing in the site's files.  This site is mostly just an exercise in using Angular2's format of laying out and displaying data on pages, as well as Angular's pipe to filter information on an array of objects.

## Specifications

| behavior |  input   |  output  |
|----------|:--------:|:--------:|
|Allow the user enter an age and display all animals up to that age. | "2" | *List of all animals up to age 2* |
|Allow the user to specify a diet type and display all animals fitting that diet type  |  "Carnivore" | *Displays a list of all carnivores and omnivores.* |


## Usage

Navigate to the homepage and choose which search terms you would like to use to filter the list of animals in the database by.  This will allow for much easier selection of animals by a specific criteria.
